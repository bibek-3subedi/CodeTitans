RentEasy is an attempt to reduce the major problem regarding renting in Kathmandu.

Tenents are kicked out with no prior warning,
Agents take too much commission and are not trustworthy,
The digital systems that do exist donot have a trust factor.

The market is huge while the implementations are weak.

RentEasy makes it easy for tenents to find their preffered room(s) and owners to find preffered tenents.
